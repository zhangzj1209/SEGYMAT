# Matlab module of exploration seismology

## SeismicLab
- SeismicLab is a MATLAB seismic data processing package. It was developed by the [***Signal Analysis and Imaging Group***](https://saig.physics.ualberta.ca/) of the University of Alberta, Canada.
- The package can be used to process small seismic data sets and, it is mainly intended for research and teaching purposes. Scripts to read and write SU data (the SEGY flavor used by [Seismic Un*x](www.cwp.mines.edu/cwpcodes/index.html)) are provided. A particular feature of this package is that the SEGY headers are loaded into a structure that can be easily assessed by MATLAB.
- Users can download the relevant information through the website http://seismic-lab.physics.ualberta.ca/.
