## SeismicLab

### MATLAB research tools to read, write and process seismic data

First do the following:

 * Copy the file `./SETPATH/setpath.m` into your working directory and modify it.
 * Run `setpath` to have access to SeismicLab codes, data and demos.
 * Good luck!

The old SeismicLab software from 1997 was written to provide examples to undergraduates taking my courses. The old  repository is here &mdash; http://seismic-lab.physics.ualberta.ca/ &mdash; but it is not mantained anymore. So if you want to use SeismicLab, please download this version from GitHub.
